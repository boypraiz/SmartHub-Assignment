<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><b>Time</b> present and time past are both perhaps present in time future 
    and time future contained in time past, 
    <i><mark>if all time is eternally present,
    all time is unredeemable.</mark></i>
    What might have been is an abstraction,
    remaining a perpetual possibility only in a world of speculation.
    <i><mark>What might have been and what has been point to one end,
    which is always present.</mark></i><br>
    Footfalls echo in the memory.
    Down the path we did not take, towards the door
    we never opened, into the rose-garden. My words echo
    thus, in your mind. But to what purpose disturbing the dust
    on a bowl of rose-leaves I do not know. Other echoes inhabit
    the garden. Shall we follow?<br><br> <b>- T.S. ELLIOT</b>
